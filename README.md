# supermarket-security-case

## Overview
This repository presents a complete cybersecurity case study based on an academic project, covering both a security assessment phase and a subsequent incident response scenario within a supermarket enterprise environment.

The project follows a realistic security lifecycle approach, from risk identification and threat analysis to incident response and security improvement recommendations.

## Scope
- Environment and risk assessment
- Threat and vulnerability analysis
- Incident detection and response
- Lessons learned and security improvements

## Project Phases

### Phase 1 — Security Assessment & Risk Analysis
Analysis of the organizational context, infrastructure, and security posture, identifying key risks and vulnerabilities that increase the attack surface.

### Phase 2 — Incident Response
Evaluation of a security incident affecting business operations, including impact assessment, response actions, and mitigation strategies.

## Key Takeaways
- Proactive security assessments are critical to reduce organizational risk
- Lack of monitoring and response planning significantly increases incident impact
- Structured incident response processes improve resilience and recovery
