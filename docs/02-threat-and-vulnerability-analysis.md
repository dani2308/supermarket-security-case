## Threat Landscape

The environment is exposed to multiple threat vectors commonly associated with enterprise networks, including unauthorized access, malware infections, and service disruption attacks.

## Identified Vulnerabilities

- Lack of network segmentation
- Insufficient access control mechanisms
- Absence of centralized logging and monitoring
- No formal incident response plan

## Risk Assessment

The combination of exposed services and limited defensive controls significantly increases the likelihood of successful attacks and delays detection and response efforts.
